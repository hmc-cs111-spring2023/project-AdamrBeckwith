# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

Most of the critique was structural and positive. So for the time being a lot of it is on the backburner. I will check back later.

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

Some reps to look at https://github.com/hmc-cs111-spring2023/hw-7-piconot-rydermitchell-hw7/blob/main/build.md

This week I did not work as much as I would have liked. I mainly just took our sample solution from hw7 and converted it into my artifact repo. I want to use its external solution as structure for my own.  The main progress I made was on a language for parseing my language. Check it out in artifact [design.md](https://github.com/hmc-cs111-spring2023/artifact-AdamrBeckwith/blob/main/design.md) would love feedback on that setup. (I am considering the writing there as part of this notebook) 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I need to work more. That is the biggest issue. Im struggling to *do* so maybe I need to define my direction better. 


**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

I would love any feedback on the structural design I have so far, and any tips for going forward with a external language. 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

3 hours 

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Not well. I am very behind on a lot of projects including this one
