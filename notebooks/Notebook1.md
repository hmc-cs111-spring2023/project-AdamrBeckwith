# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

It was very nice being able to talk with my tablemate on monday. I feel like we both have similar goals in the project. Although the actually feedback on my project was minimal, there we key insights I learned from our interaction. 

First off, I definitely realized how badly defined my project was. Although I knew what I *wanted* I didn't really have any logistics figured out. Sure, a gui that a user can interact with is easy to say but not easily done. I also realized we both probably over commited to a project ie made it more complicated then can be done in the time required. So going into this designing section I want to clearly define these issues. 

In tandem with that I need some clear examples of the DSL. The feedback showed me that how the dsl will work also needs some defining. Is it something that rolls singular events? Or something that creates graphs? That is a question I need to answer. 

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**
