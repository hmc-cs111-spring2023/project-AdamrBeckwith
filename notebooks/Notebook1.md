# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

It was very nice being able to talk with my tablemate on monday. I feel like we both have similar goals in the project. Although the actually feedback on my project was minimal, there we key insights I learned from our interaction. 

First off, I definitely realized how badly defined my project was. Although I knew what I *wanted* I didn't really have any logistics figured out. Sure, a gui that a user can interact with is easy to say but not easily done. I also realized we both probably over commited to a project ie made it more complicated then can be done in the time required. So going into this designing section I want to clearly define these issues. 

In tandem with that I need some clear examples of the DSL. The feedback showed me that how the dsl will work also needs some defining. Is it something that rolls singular events? Or something that creates graphs? That is a question I need to answer. Ideally both but again we need to keep it realistic.

## Description

So the first step of this week was working to create a step by step guide of 1 what I was making and 2 how I was going to do it. In advance I apologize for the format of these and specifically how the typing ends up looking. I have dyslexia and it can make some of my sentences really impossible to understand (I swap word order alot). Feel free to comment on those in reviews so I can fix them.
